        "\n",
        "Q1] What is hypothesis testing in statistics?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- Hypothesis testing in statistics is a method used to make decisions or inferences about a population based on sample data.\n",
        "     It helps you determine whether there is enough evidence in a sample to support a specific claim about the population.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2] What is the null hypothesis, and how does it differ from the alternative hypothesis?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- 1. Null Hypothesis (H₀):\n",
        "        * It's the default assumption or starting point.\n",
        "        * It states that there is no effect, no difference, or no change.\n",
        "        * It’s what you try to disprove or test against.\n",
        "\n",
        "    2. Alternative Hypothesis (H₁ or Ha):\n",
        "        * It’s the opposite of the null hypothesis.\n",
        "        * It suggests that there is an effect, a difference, or a change.\n",
        "        * It’s what you're trying to find evidence for.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3] What is the significance level in hypothesis testing, and why is it important?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- The significance level (usually written as α, alpha) is a threshold you set before doing a hypothesis test. It tells you how much\n",
        "     risk of making a wrong decision (a false positive) you're willing to accept.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4] What does a P-value represent in hypothesis testing?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- The p-value is the probability of getting your observed results (or something even more extreme) if the null hypothesis were true.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5] How do you interpret the P-value in hypothesis testing?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- ✅ Step 1: Understand the Hypotheses\n",

        "\n",
        "        Alternative hypothesis (H₁): There is an effect or difference.\n",
        "\n",
        "     ✅ Step 2: Run the Test and Get a P-value\n",
        "        You use a statistical test (like a t-test, z-test, etc.) and get a p-value — a number between 0 and 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "    ✅ Step 3: Compare the P-value to Your Significance Level (α)\n",
        "       Usually, α = 0.05 (5%) unless stated otherwise.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q6] What are Type 1 and Type 2 errors in hypothesis testing?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- Type I Error (False Positive): You reject the null hypothesis (H₀), but it was actually true.\n",
        "     Type II Error (False Negative): You fail to reject the null hypothesis, but it was actually false.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q7] What is the difference between a one-tailed and a two-tailed test in hypothesis testing?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- In two-tailed Test you're testing for any significant difference, either higher or lower.You don't care about the direction of the\n",
        "     effect — just that there is one.\n",
        "\n",
        "     In One-Tailed Test you're testing for a difference in one specific direction — greater than or less than.\n",

        "Q8] What is the Z-test, and when is it used in hypothesis testing?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- A Z-test is a statistical method used to determine whether there is a significant difference between:\n",
        "         A sample mean and a population mean, or two sample means.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q9] How do you calculate the Z-score, and what does it represent in hypothesis testing?\n",
        "\n",

        "Q10] What is the T-distribution, and when should it be used instead of the normal distribution?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- The T-distribution (or Student's t-distribution) is a probability distribution that’s very similar to the normal distribution, but it has\n",
        "     thicker tails — meaning it accounts for more variability, especially in smaller samples.It’s used in statistics when you're doing inference\n",

        "  *Both test if the observed sample mean is significantly different from the expected population mean (under the null hypothesis).\n",
        "  *Both use the central limit theorem, which says that as sample size increases, the distribution of sample means will approach a normal distribution.\n",

        "Q14] What is a confidence interval, and how is it used to interpret statistical results?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- A confidence interval is a range of values, derived from the sample data, that is used to estimate an unknown population parameter (such as\n",
        "     a population mean or proportion). The interval gives you a range of values within which you are reasonably confident the true population\n",

        "Q15] What is the margin of error, and how does it affect the confidence interval?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- The margin of error (MOE) is a measure of the uncertainty or precision in an estimate. It tells you how much the sample statistic (like the\n",
        "     sample mean) might differ from the true population parameter (like the population mean).In the context of confidence intervals, the margin of\n",
        "     error is the amount added to and subtracted from the sample statistic to create the range that forms the confidence interval.The larger the\n",
        "     margin of error, the wider the confidence interval, indicating more uncertainty in the estimate.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans- Bayes' Theorem is a fundamental concept in probability and statistics, allowing us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event\n",
        "     based on new evidence. It is especially useful in situations where we want to refine our understanding of the likelihood of an event occurring,\n",
        "     given additional data or prior knowledge.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q17]  What is the Chi-square distribution, and when is it used?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- The Chi-square distribution is a probability distribution that is widely used in statistics, particularly for hypothesis testing and in\n",
        "     scenarios involving categorical data. It is a special case of the gamma distribution and is used primarily in tests that assess whether\n",

        "     theoretical distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q19] What is the F-distribution, and when is it used in hypothesis testing?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- The F-distribution is a probability distribution that is used in hypothesis testing, especially in the context of comparing variances across\n",
        "     multiple groups or populations. It is particularly important in analysis of variance (ANOVA), regression analysis, and testing the equality of\n",
        "    variances between two or more groups.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q20] What is an ANOVA test, and what are its assumptions?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is a statistical test used to determine if there are any significant differences between the means of three or\n",
        "     more groups. It compares the variation within each group (how much the data points vary within each group) to the variation between the groups\n",
        "    (how much the group means differ from each other). The goal of ANOVA is to test whether at least one group mean is significantly different from\n",

        "\n",
        "Independence of Observations:\n",
        "\n",
        "The data points in each group should be independent of each other. This means the value of one observation in a group should not influence the value of another observation in the same group or in another group.\n",
        "\n",
        "Violation: If data points are related (e.g., repeated measurements from the same subjects), this assumption is violated, and a repeated measures ANOVA might be needed instead.\n",
        "\n",
        "Normality:\n",
        "\n",
        "The data within each group should be approximately normally distributed. While ANOVA is somewhat robust to violations of normality when sample sizes are large (thanks to the Central Limit Theorem), this assumption is more important when sample sizes are small.\n",
        "\n",
        "Violation: If data is significantly skewed, transformation of data or using non-parametric tests may be necessary.\n",
        "\n",
        "Homogeneity of Variances (Homoscedasticity):\n",
        "\n",
        "The variance (spread) within each group should be approximately equal. This assumption is crucial because ANOVA tests the ratio of variances (between-group vs. within-group). If variances are unequal, the results of the test may be misleading.\n",
        "\n",
        "Violation: If variances are unequal (i.e., heteroscedasticity), a Welch’s ANOVA or a non-parametric test like the Kruskal-Wallis test can be used.\n",

        "One-Way ANOVA:\n",
        "\n",
        "Compares the means of three or more groups based on a single factor (independent variable).\n",
